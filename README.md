# Stopwatch

## A stopwatch made using JavaScript. It forms part of a coding challenge for TPXImpact.

#The Task 

## For this task I created an HTML page with a functional stopwatch. The stopwatch is accurate.

# User Stories

## This stopwatch displauys to the user the current elapsed time in the following format 00:00:00:00 (hours, minutes, seconds, centiseconds)

## The user can push a start button to start or continue a timer.

## Ths user can push a pause button to pause the running timer.

## The user can push a reset/clear button to reset the timer to zero.

## The user can push a lap button : A button is a button to write the time to a list/table of laps (it does not pause the timer). The results are shown on screen and are still be visible if the page is refreshed.

## The user can push the reset/ clear button to clear any lap history.

## Bonus points:
Lap button: A button to write the time to a list/table of laps (this would not pause the timer). The results should be shown on screen and still be visible if the page is refreshed.

## Clear lap history button: A button to clear any lap history

## Make it look good

## No bugs or quirky behaviour

## Any build tools, instructions or other things you think a good project should include
